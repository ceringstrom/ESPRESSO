# ESPRESSO
ESPRESSO (Entropy and ShaPe awaRe timE-Series SegmentatiOn) is a hybrid segmentation model for multi-dimensional time-series that is formulated to exploit the entropy and temporal shape properties of time-series. ESPRESSO differs from existing methods that focus upon particular statistical or temporal properties of time-series exclusively. ESPRESSO has been used to extract meaningful temporal segments from high-dimensional wearable sensor data, smart devices, or IoT data as a vital preprocessing step for Human Activity Recognition (HAR), trajectory prediction, gesture recognition, and lifelogging, and smart cities. Available in matlab and python( comming soon).
